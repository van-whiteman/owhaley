# owhaley

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of owhaley is to produce a whale with a nice message for STAT1378 tutorial work.

owhaley is a work in progress and can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/):
```{r, install, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("van-whiteman/owhaley")
```


## Example
`owhaley` contains one function only. `say()` will echo a randomly chosen whale-themed phrase for your enjoyment.

```{r example}
library(owhaley)
say() 
```



Alternatively, you can supply your own phrase

```{r, customise}
say("I'm beached as bro!!!")
```
't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
